\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am currently undergoing a Masters of Public Health with an IPAC specialization, with aspirations toward field epidemiology and IPAC within hospital settings. My personal interests reside in enhancing obsolete patient management systems in patient care settings with modern communication technologies in order to optimize health care surveillance and delivery. As an advocate of digital privacy during the modern era of invasive surveillance, my passion lies in retaining maximum privacy while recognizing the tangible value of surveillance. Ultimately, my long-term intent consolidates my knowledge of computers and digital privacy with the experiences I gain in health care to help contribute to the field in a novel way.

% \lettersection{Why ?}

\lettersection{Qualifications}
The MPH-IPAC graduate program provides training in three main areas: Skills in literature review specifically applicable to public health, knowledge in program planning and evaluation through learned frameworks and epidemiological methods, and the breadth of IPAC responsibilities encountered in hospital settings. In addition to the aforementioned academic training, my previous work in hospital patient care as a student nurse and further experience in business-to-business support and retail have afforded me experience in administrative skills, data management, and communication. Although my academic degree relates to health, I am proficient with computers, in both hardware and software. If specialized software is utilized in the workplace, I have the highest confidence in my ability to quickly gain familiarity with the tool. I have encountered highly fragmented toolsets during my experience in B2B support and hospitals, and have had no issue with gaining proficiency in a short period of time.

\lettersection{Closing}
Thank you for your time. Given the opportunity, I am confident I can exceed your expectations. If any further information is required, please do not hesitate to ask.
